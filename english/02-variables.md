It's possible to set something called "variables" in Python.
"x" and "y" in algebra are variables, it's the same concept.

You can set a variable like this:

	x = 15

Or like this:

	a = "Hi, from Norway!"

It's also possible to print a variable:

	print(a)

You can even work with variables:

	a = 5
	b = 7
	sum = a + b
	print(sum)

First task
----------

Make a program called `number-variables.py` that does the following:

- Create a variable called `x` and set it's value to the number `15`
- Create another variable called `y` and set it's value to the number `6`
- Create a last variable called `result` and set it's value to "x+y"
- Print the `result` variable

Second task
-----------

Make a program called `text-variables.py` that does the following:

- Create a variable called `a` and set it's value to the text "wo de ma"
- Print the variable `a`
- Create a variable `b` and set it's value to the text "ya"
- Print the two variables `a` and `b` added together (`a + b`)

Third task
----------

Make a program called `mixed-variables.py` that does the following:

- Create a variable called `text` and set it's value to the text "liang fen"
- Create a second variable called `number` and set it's value to the number `88`
- Try adding them together: `result = text + number`
- Find a way to add them together, so that the `print(result)` gives the text "liang fen 88"
